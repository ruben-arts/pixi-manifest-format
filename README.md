# The `pixi.toml` schema format

This repository contains the [JSON Schema](./schema.json) for the `pixi.toml` format used by the `pixi` tool as a configuration file.

To use the schema in vs-code you need a TOML parsing extension and add the following line to the file:
```toml
#:schema https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ruben-arts/pixi-manifest-format/main/schema.json
```
